## About The Project

Book Lovers is a web application that lets users search for a book based on author, title, subject, and genre. Books will be displayed based on their unique ISBN. LocalStorage will be used to store data of most recently searches and be displayed for the user to quickly navigate.

SO THAT I can view the books and check if they're available on Google.
```

```
GIVEN a book dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I load the page
THEN I am presented with the UI that resembles with the mockup

WHEN I search for a book
THEN I am presented with series of search results

WHEN I view a search card
THEN I am presented with the book title, cover, author, ISBN and published year and a link to view your book in Google/Amazon.

WHEN I click on the Google/Amazon link
THEN I am presented with the book in Google/Amazon in a new tab
